# charge2GO

Charge2GO is a smart barter system to exchange charge between electric cars to reduce downtime.

# Current Problem

The current problem with all the electric vehicle owners is Range Anxiety as a result you never know when you will run out of charge. When you do, you never know where the nearest unoccupied charging station is.

# Proposed Solution

How would it be if every electric car on the road could be potential charging station. This way the vehicle owners can obtain charge not only from other charging stations but also from the stationary cars on the road. The donor ( the owner of the vehicle willing to donate charge) gets an incentive based on the number of units of charge he willing  to donate.

# How to use the application

## Travel to destination

First , on the launch screen of the app, the user enters his name and the units of charge he has at the start of his journey. He also can select which type of car he is travelling in. Next on the map, he chooses the destination location and starts his travel.


## Request for charge

Once his charge drops below a certain threshold a pop up appears saying he can request for charge. In the pop up he chooses the units of charge he requires.Now the request message is sent to all the neighbouring cars in a 4 mile radius.

## Respond to request for charge

If a car is within the 4 mile radius of the requesting car and has enoigh charge then a pop up will appear on the donor s side showing him the location of the requesting car and the units of charge requested. Along with this,  the max units of charge that he can donate is displayed in the popup. In this popup the donor can enter the units of charge he is willing to donate and the credit points that he will recieve can be seen by him.
